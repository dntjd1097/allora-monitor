At a given timestamp, the current price is the price at that time, and the new price would be the price 1 hour later. Use these two prices to calculate the Log-Return as explained above, and then train your model with the Log-Return as the target variable.\n\nFor reliable data sources, we recommend platforms like [Tiingo](https://www.tiingo.com/), [Dune](https://dune.com/product/api), [CoinMarketCap](https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/api/), and [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api).\n\nYou can also explore on-chain data providers like [Space and Time](https://www.spaceandtime.io/sxt-platform/db), [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/apis) or APIs from exchanges like [Binance](https://oracle.binance.com/en/data-feeds) and [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/en-gb/developer-platform/products/exchange-api) for granular trading data.\n\nYou are free to use whatever data sources and transformations you would like to build your model.\n\n_**Disclaimer:** Participants may be required to access third-party platforms to obtain relevant data for the competition.

Put your skills to the test by developing a model that captures and analyzes Ethereum‚Äôs volatility, recalculating and updating every 5 minutes. Can you create a model that outperforms the rest and delivers real-time insights into market fluctuations? Jump in and prove it.\n\n## Overview\n\nParticipants in this competition will develop a model to capture Ethereum‚Äôs volatility over the next 6 hours, updating every 5 minutes with real-time market data. Your challenge is to create a system that effectively analyzes price fluctuations and trading activity, providing precise and timely insights into Ethereum market movements.\n\nIn this challenge, volatility is measured as the standardized rolling standard deviation of log returns, calculated over a 6-hour(360 minutes) period. The log returns are computed at a chosen frequency, then multiplied by a standardization factor: `sqrt(360 / frequency_minutes)`. Models will be evaluated based on their ability to accurately capture volatility patterns within the defined intervals. This is an opportunity to showcase your technical expertise and market understanding in a competitive, data-driven environment.\n\n**Volatility calculation steps:**\n\n- Calculate log returns at a chosen frequency (e.g., 1-minute or 5-minute intervals)\n- Compute the rolling standard deviation of these log returns over a 6-hour period\n- Standardize this value by multiplying it with a factor: `sqrt(360 / frequency_in_minutes)`\n\nThis standardization allows for fair comparison of volatility across different calculation frequencies.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Using 1-minute data:** factor = `sqrt(360)` ‚âà 18.97\n- **Using 5-minute data:** factor = `sqrt(72)` ‚âà 8.48\n\nSo, a raw volatility with standard deviation of 0.0025 would result in:\n\n- 0.0474 standardized volatility for 1-minute data\n- 0.0212 standardized volatility for 5-minute data\n\n## How It Works\n\n1.

Put your skills to the test by developing a model that captures and analyzes Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility, recalculating and updating every 5 minutes. Can you create a model that outperforms the rest and delivers real-time insights into market fluctuations? Jump in and prove it.\n\n## Overview\n\nParticipants in this competition will develop a model to capture Bitcoin‚Äôs volatility over the next 6 hours, updating every 5 minutes with real-time market data. Your challenge is to create a system that effectively analyzes price fluctuations and trading activity, providing precise and timely insights into Bitcoin‚Äôs market movements.\n\nIn this challenge, volatility is measured as the standardized rolling standard deviation of log returns, calculated over a 6-hour(360 minutes) period. The log returns are computed at a chosen frequency, then multiplied by a standardization factor: `sqrt(360 / frequency_minutes)`. Models will be evaluated based on their ability to accurately capture volatility patterns within the defined intervals. This is an opportunity to showcase your technical expertise and market understanding in a competitive, data-driven environment.\n\n**Volatility calculation steps:**\n\n- Calculate log returns at a chosen frequency (e.g., 1-minute or 5-minute intervals)\n- Compute the rolling standard deviation of these log returns over a 6-hour period\n- Standardize this value by multiplying it with a factor: `sqrt(360 / frequency_in_minutes)`\n\nThis standardization allows for fair comparison of volatility across different calculation frequencies.\n\n**Examples:**\n\n- **Using 1-minute data:** factor = `sqrt(360)` ‚âà 18.97\n- **Using 5-minute data:** factor = `sqrt(72)` ‚âà 8.48\n\nSo, a raw volatility with standard deviation of 0.0025 would result in:\n\n- 0.0474 standardized volatility for 1-minute data\n- 0.0212 standardized volatility for 5-minute data\n\n## How It Works\n\n1.
